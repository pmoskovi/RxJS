##Reactive Messaging API

###Contents:

- **messaging-reactive.js:** A new messaging library prototype that provides higher level abstraction on top of Kaazing JMS Client Library. The library is Promise/A+ spec compliant and supports Reactive Extensions.
- **example-reactive.js:** Example using new messaing library prototype and RxJS library.
- **legacy-example.js:** It provides an example using the traditional JMS Client Library.

The examples are primitive and use browser console as of now to print messages.
The html files are used to load the javascript files.
The example outlines the couple of use cases and demonstrates how they are tackled using the tranditional library and the new messaging library (in conjunction with RxJS)
